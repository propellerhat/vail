# Vail
A morse code generator. Named after [Alfred Lewis Vail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Vail).

## Why?
All morse code tutors that I've used have been lacking. G4FON is my go-to, but it has bugs and has a limited character set (no prosigns and almost no puncuation). It also only runs on Windows. I don't like having to fire up a VM each time I want a simple practice session.
